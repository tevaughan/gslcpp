      # WARNING: Avoid installing 'publish_dir/.gitignore' in main branch if
      # purpose be to hide products of build in output of 'git status' and if
      # products be intended for gh-pages.  peaceiris's action works well, but
      # it will silently fail to deploy any files and/or directories mentioned
      # in 'publish_dir/.gitignore'.  In order to hide products of build on
      # main branch, put entry for 'publish_dir' into top-level '.gitignore'.
