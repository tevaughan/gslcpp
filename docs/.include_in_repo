This file exists so that the docs-directory will be included in the repository.

- If I do the trick of using '.gitignore' here and then ignoring all of the
  products of the build, then nothing will be pushed by the gh-pages deploy
  script.

- If I have no file in this directory corresponding to the repository, then the
  directory will be pruned and the gh-pages deployment will fail when the
  build-system tries to write the products of code-coverage here.
