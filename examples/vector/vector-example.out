v1 has, on stack, elements and internal vector-view.
Instance of gsl_vector_view consumes 40 bytes on 64-bit hardware.
sizeof(v1)=56 v1=[(1,-1),(0.5,0.6)]
v1.get(1)=(0.5,0.6)

v2 also has, on stack, elements and internal vector-view.
sizeof(v2)=16 v2=[1,3,5,7,9]
v2.max()=9

v3 has, on stack, pointer to vtable and pointer to gsl_vector.
Pointer to vtable is stored because dynamic vector (with compile-
time size of 0) has virtual destructor.
sizeof(v3)=16 v3=[0,0,0,0]
v3.isnull()=1

v4 also has, on stack, ptr to vtable and ptr to gsl_vector.
sizeof(v4)=16 v4=[1,2,3,4]
v4.subvector(2, 1, 2)=[2,4]

v5 also has, on stack, ptr to vtable and ptr to gsl_vector.
sizeof(v5)=16 v5=[1,3,5]
v5.max_index()=2
